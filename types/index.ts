/**
 * @deprecated This file is being migrated to the new modular type system.
 * Please use imports from @/lib/types instead.

 * This file is kept for backward compatibility during the migration.

// Re-export everything from the new types system
export * from '@/lib/types'

// Note: All types are now available through the new modular system
// Use specific imports like: import { Board, Participant } from '@/lib/types'
// Or for API types: import { CreateBoardRequest } from '@/lib/types/api'
